DITA OT With i18n Plugin Integrated 
===================================

This container provides a working image
of the DITA Open Toolkit with the DITA Community
Internationalization plugin integrated.

It is identical to the generic OT container except it is based on the dita-ot-i18n-base Docker image and you use it in exactly the same way. See https://hub.docker.com/r/ditaot/dita-ot/
